# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling during database interactions within route handlers.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where database errors are simply logged to the console without providing feedback to the client.  This can lead to confusing error messages for users or application crashes.

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version with robust error handling.  It returns appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON error responses to the client, improving the overall user experience and stability of the application.
